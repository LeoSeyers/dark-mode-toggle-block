# Dark Mode Toggle Block

A WordPress block to add a toggle between light and dark appearances, as seen on [my blog](https://rich.blog). Adds a `theme-dark` class to the body element, when toggled on. The user's preference is then saved in local storage. Built with [@wordpress/create-block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/).
